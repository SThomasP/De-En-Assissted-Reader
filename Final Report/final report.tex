This report proposes and then details the development and testing process of a gloss application designed to help German language learners discover and then read authentic articles from German news sources. It begins by outlining the application before starting research into the logic and methods such an application would use. Once these have been decided on, the project then goes on to detail how the application was designed and programmed, listing the choices made and the reasoning behind them. The report then details and analyses the results of user testing on the application, before performing a critical evaluation of the both the application and the project as a whole, detailing their flaws and the various methods by which they could be improved. The report then concludes by examining how the application could be improved for a future commercial version before deciding that such improvements are not viable.
