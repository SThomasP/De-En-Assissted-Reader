\chapter{Application Development Methodology}

\section{Readings and Research}


\section{Sprints}

The application was developed using AGILE methods. The project was divided into six sprints and they were completed in the order in which they are described. The order was chosen as it would allow the application to reach minimal viable project status as soon as possible (end of sprint 3), leaving the more advanced sprints for later. The sprints are detailed below.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Translation Lookup}
	
	The aim of this sprint is to establish a valid method to retrieve single word translation and grammatical data.
	
	\item \textbf{Article Parsing \& Presentation}
	
	The aim of this sprint is develop a method for the parsing of articles and then to present them through a web browser
	
	\item \textbf{AJAX}
	
	The aim of this sprint is to develop the javscript code that will allow the gloss to display entries.
	
	\item \textbf{Advance Parsing}
	
	The aim of this sprint is to allow advanced parsing methods to be performed on the text. Allowing for parts of speech identification of words. 
	
	\item \textbf{Article Discovery}
	
	The aim of this sprint is get the application to find articles on it's own, removing the need for the user to find their own articles.
	
	\item \textbf{Difficulty Rating System}
	
	The aim of this sprint it to develop the system that allows the application to rate how difficult the user will find various articles. 
	
\end{enumerate}

AGILE methodologies were used as they allowed the developer to have regular meetings with the project supervisor, discussing the progress made, what was left to be done whether or not it was achievable.

\section{Testing}

Testing was done in various stages throughout the project and can be divided into two main parts.
