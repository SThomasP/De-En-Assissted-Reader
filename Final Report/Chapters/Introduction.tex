\section{Problem}
While learning a second language, many learners encounter problems while trying to find and read texts written in the language they are learning. Modern technology has helped with this to some regard, with development of glosses, which provide prompts for vocabulary words. These prompts can be translations of the words, definitions in the source language, audio visual materials or any combination of the above. 

The problem most glosses developed today have is that they are specifically tailored for the text they are being used on. The words that can be examined are pre-selected, the gloss content is pre-written and the text has been pre-selected. This still leaves multiple problems for the user. They could not find the text interesting, they could already know the words in the gloss and they might find the text too easy. 

\section{Solution and Goals}

The solution to this problem was, perhaps unsurprisingly, to develop a prototype application. This application should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Allow the user to a select a category of articles that they find interesting.
	
	\item Find and pull articles in that category from a variety of news sources.
	
	\item Rate the articles based on their perceived difficulty for the user.
	
	\item Allow the user to activate a gloss on any and all words in the article. 
\end{itemize}

To make sure as many platforms are supported as easily as possible, the application will run in a web browser and be hosted remotely. The initial prototype of the application will support German in order to minimise the number of variable that need to be taken into account and because German is a language the developer can speak, allowing for easier development of the application.

Once developed, this  prototype application will then be user tested by a number of German learners of varying experience levels. They will provide feedback on their experiences using the application, which will then be examine and used to formulate the idea of a release build.
