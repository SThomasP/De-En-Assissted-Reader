\chapter{Background Reading}

Reading for the project can be divided into reading about the gloss aspect of the application, and then reading about a difficulty rating system. Each of these parts of the reading happened independently, as their subject matter are largely unrelated.


\section{Glosses}

The research done into glosses is divided into to parts, the first being research into whether or not glosses are effective, the second part was about the various designs of glosses, trying to discover which ones were the most effective.

\subsection{Effectiveness of Electronic Glosses}

\textcite{abraham2008} finds that, overall, learners with access to an electronic gloss will perform better than learners without access, in both skills of reading comprehension and vocabulary retention, particularly on intermediate learners. \textcite{abraham2008} then notes that the small sample size of studies analysed should mean that their study is not seen as conclusive evidence, however suggestive evidence is enough to establish that development of this project should continue.

Another caveat that should also be added is that most of the studies analysed in \textcite{abraham2008} are of tailor-made glosses designed for a specific text, as such the research findings of these studies and the meta-study may not be fully applicable to this project.


\subsection{Design Methods of Electronic Glosses}

\textcite{roby1999} identifies three main parts of a gloss' design, its presentation, its taxonomy and its density. However, as density, which is the amount of content in the gloss, is something determined by the user, background reading into design was limited to presentation and taxonomy. 

\subsubsection{Gloss Presentation}

Gloss presentations is how the gloss is presented relative to the text. 

\textcite{chen2016} identifies the three most researched gloss presentations as: in-text, marginal and pop up.  \textcite{abuseileek2008} finds that out of these three the marginal presentation category performs the best in both vocabulary retention and reading comprehension, while \textcite{marefat2016} finds that pop-ups are more effective than marginal for reading comprehension. As \textcite{chen2016} says, there has not been sufficient research into gloss location for valid conclusions to be drawn. 

\subsubsection{Gloss Taxonomy}

Gloss taxonomy is the content of the gloss.

\textcite{gettys2001} finds that dictionary style translations perform better than sentence level translations, suggesting that it would be better to translate the dictionary form of the word, providing information about how the word changed from its dictionary form to its current form in the article. 

There is a large body of research that suggests that providing multimedia glosses is more effective than providing text only ones. \autocite{yoshii2006, kost1999}. This is harder to implement  as it would the application to have a better understanding of the word's context to provided an accurate image of the word. 


\section{Article Difficulty Rating}

The reading for this section of the application was harder to find, little has been written about the discovery and difficulty rating of texts for second language learners in general, or German learners in specific. 

The easiest method of calculating the difficulty of an article seems to be a mathematical expression of it's readability, called a readability index. Perhaps the most famous of these being the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) formula \autocite{flesch1948}. This formula is for America English, but similar formulae have been developed for German, two of these are highlighted below.

The first formula for German is an adaptation of the FRE formula as proposed in \textcite{amstad1978}, this relies on much the same model as the original FRE formula. The formula takes into account the longer average word length in the German language, this formula is show in Figure \ref{fig:fre} where ASL is the average sentence length and ASW is the average syllables per word. This formula maps the readability of the text onto a range of 0 to 100, with 0 being easy and 100 being hard. 

\input{Figures/FreFormula}

The other readability index for German is the  Wiener Sachtextformel (WSTF) as proposed in \textcite{bamberger1984}, one version of this is as shown in Figure \ref{fig:wst}. Where MS is the percentage of words with three or syllables, SL is the average sentence length, IW is the percentage of words with six or more characters and ES is the percentage of monosyllabic words. This formula maps the difficulty rating onto a range of 4 to 15, with the lower numbers being easier. This is done to reflect the German school year that is believed to be appropriate for that level of text.

\input{Figures/WstfFormula}

The two formulae are commonly used together when assessing the readability of texts, being used in a variety of studies, such as \textcite{rottensteiner2010} which uses them both to assess the readability of newly published textbooks. This publication also notes that these formulae only measure the linguistic complexity of the article, ignoring other factors, such as presentation, that influence how easy the article is to read. 

In addition to the formulae listed above there are methods of determining a readability ranking through the use of machine learning. \textcite{hancke2012} attempt to build a readability classification system from a corpus of articles. This paper looks a lot more in depth at a lot of features of the text. However, this model only performed 7.5\% better than the computational scores calculated from the traditional formula. Given the time constraints and the already complex nature of the project, it would not be worth the effort to implement such a model, as the tradition formulae such as WSTF and FRE perform well enough for the purposes of this project.
