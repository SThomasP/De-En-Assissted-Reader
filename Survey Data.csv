Listing all of the cases is a little bit pointless. It would be better to have the gender, number and case of the word in the context that it is in it beim Hund - masculine, singular, dative.
Might be useful to identify verbs that are in the Subjunctive, as these verbs may confuse beginners. Er gebe is quite a weird thing to read if you don't know that the subjunctive exists."

- Long words hide the X button on the annotations
- Translations showed the same translation multiple times
- Translations are shown at the bottom of the text, they should be given prominence in the UI (i.e. bolded or near the top)
